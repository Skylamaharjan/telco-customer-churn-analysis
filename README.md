## Key Insights

- Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts are far more likely to churn than those on longer-term contracts (1 or 2 years). This suggests the need for loyalty programs or incentives to push longer commitments.

- Tenure Group: Customers with 12 months or less of tenure churn at a significantly higher rate than long-term customers. Early onboarding and engagement strategies could reduce early churn.

- Payment Method: Electronic check users have a higher churn rate compared to other payment methods. Encouraging auto-pay options could improve retention.

- Internet Service: Customers with Fiber optic service churn more than those with DSL or no internet. This may point to service quality or pricing issues needing attention.

- Gender: No significant difference observed in churn between male and female customers.



## Recommendations

1. Introduce loyalty discounts or benefits for customers who commit to longer contracts.
2. Improve early customer experience (first 6–12 months), perhaps through personalized offers or welcome programs.
3. Incentivize auto-payment options over manual billing to reduce churn from payment-related friction.
4. Investigate satisfaction among Fiber customers— high churn may indicate pricing or quality concerns.
